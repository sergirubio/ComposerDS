New objectives for ComposerDS
=============================

Use ComposerDS to provide a "hub" to the Control system for external applications (aka WEB).

The idea is that the composer provides a way to map and export attributes and commands from the control system to the internet.

It should be capable to trigger Server-Sent Events as well as generate .json and .json.gz data files.
